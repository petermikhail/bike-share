​
### Name: Peter Mikhail
​
### Date: July 21, 2023
​
### Tool: R Programming Language
​
### Introduction
​
This case study is my capstone project of the Google Data Analytics course.
​
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will imagine I am working for a fictional company called, Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
​
In this version of case study, I will perform all the processes of data analysis in R.
​
 ### Scenario
 
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. This company has two types of customers, Casual riders, and members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
​
### The Objective 
​
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
​
### Deliverables
​
1. A clear statement of the business task
​
2. A description of all data sources used
 
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
​
4. A summary of my analysis
​
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings 
​
6. my top three recommendations based on your analysis
​
### The data analysis process
​
### Prepare 
​
I used Cyclistic’s historical trip data from the previous 12 months( January to December, 2022). It is a public dataset located on the cloud (AWS). The data was downloaded and stored on my local drive for further exploration.  
The data is ROCC compliant. It is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited.
​
### Process 
​
In data processing, I will use R to combine, clean, transform the data to be ready for analysis.
​
First, I need to call the following libraries
